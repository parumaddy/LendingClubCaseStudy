## General Information
- Lending to 'high-risk' applicants is the primary source of financial loss, known as credit loss. 
  Credit loss refers to the amount of money a lender loses when a borrower defaults or absconds with the owed amount.
  The key objective is to identify these high-risk loan applicants, allowing the company to minimize such loans and 
  consequently reduce credit losses. The goal of this case study is to identify these applicants through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  Conduct an analysis to determine the key factors (or driver variables) that contribute to loan defaultsâ€”those 
  variables that strongly indicate the likelihood of default. The company can use this insight to enhance 
  its portfolio management and risk assessment strategies
